# Getting Started

This project is a React application that displays current clothing items to users of the site.
Not only does this application display clothing items, but the aplication also gets the current weather
in the users location and can switch between fahrenheit and celsius units as well. The application will
then filter clothing items from a mock json server and will recommend certain clothing items to the user
based on the weather.

## Current programming features

Here are the main programming features of this application so far:

- React components
- Api server requests
- React Hooks
- lifting state
- React Context
- React Routing

## Future development goals

My main goals for this application in the future is to make this application visible on github pages so users
can test, appreciate, and criticise this project so that I can make further imporvements
